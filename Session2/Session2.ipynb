    "### 4.1 Dict and set comprehensions\n",
    "Comprehensions are not just for lists. Using curly brackets you can set up dictionary and set comprehensions as well. If we're being honest though, neither of us has ever had to use a set comprehension for anything, ever. (But it's nice that the option is available.)\n",
    "### 4.2 Generator expressions\n",
    "Given that square brackets denote list comprehensions, and curly brackets denote dict/set comprehensions, you might expect that normal parentheses denote tuple comprehensions. Remember, however, that tuples are _immutable_, so a tuple comprehension wouldn't really work (although you can always use a list comprehension to create a list and then turn that into a tuple).  \n",
    "Instead, parentheses are used to denote something much more useful: Generator expressions. A _generator_ is an iterator whose values are not yet stored, but instead generated as needed."
