He should have noticed earlier; after all, Higgins had always been quite clumsy. The drool, he realized, was not an endearing character trait but actually the by-product of a haphazard yet efficient process of natural selection designed to maximize carnivorous ability. The fur he always found on his evening jacket was just an animal shedding, not a charming rural habit meant to conjure good luck and welcome friendly fae into the household. This understanding came over Lord Percy in waves: of horror, of curiosity, of shock, of love. Come Higgins, he said as the bear destroyed his 167th set of fine China, I do believe it is time for tea. As you know, old friend, I can bearly do without it.\")}')"
