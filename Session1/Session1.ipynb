    "A lot of what's in a computer is storage. This storage takes the form of little switches (_transistors_) that can be turned either on or off.\n",
    "Information stored as a sequence of switches is in _binary_ form. We usually represent binary as a sequence of ones and zeroes. Using different methods of translating (_encoding_) information to binary, we can represent all kinds of data. For instance, the number 6 can be represented as 110 (1 x 4 + 1 x 2 + 0 x 1) but we can also encode text or images. When you read about things like _utf-8_ encoding or _jpeg_ and _gif_, these refer to methods of encoding and storing complex data as ones and zeroes."

This container is actually a bit of space reserved in your computer's memory. It's worth keeping in mind that a variable is just a name pointing to the address of a container, because it explains some weird behavior we will see later.  \n",
