    "### 1.1 Basic building blocks\n",
    "A lot of what's in a computer is storage. This storage takes the form of little switches (_transistors_) that can be turned either on or off.\n",
    "Information stored as a sequence of switches is in _binary_ form. We usually represent binary as a sequence of ones and zeroes. Using different methods of translating (_encoding_) information to binary, we can represent all kinds of data. For instance, the number 6 can be represented as 110 (1 x 4 + 1 x 2 + 0 x 1) but we can also encode text or images. When you read about things like _utf-8_ encoding or _jpeg_ and _gif_, these refer to methods of encoding and storing complex data as ones and zeroes."

    "In programming, it is good practice to add comments to your code explaining what certain blocks of code do (and sometimes to warn that changing a code block can have unexpected effects) so whoever might read your code after you can figure out what's going on (often this will be your future self, trying to figure out what you wrote two years ago).  \n",

    "## ?. Variables\n",
    "Virtually all programming languages have variables, so most of you will be familiar with the concept. A variable is a name attached to a value, a container with some data in it. This container is actually a bit of space reserved in your computer's memory. It's worth keeping in mind that a variable is just a name pointing to the address of a container, because it explains some weird behavior we will see later.  \n",

    "The most basic thing to store in bits is numbers (this is what computers were originally created for) and Python of course lets you do this as well. The basic data type for numbers is the _integer_, known as `int` in Python. An integer is any whole number, either positive or negative.  \n",
