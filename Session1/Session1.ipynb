    "A lot of what's in a computer is storage. This storage takes the form of little switches (_transistors_) that can be turned either on or off.\n",
    "Information stored as a sequence of switches is in _binary_ form. We usually represent binary as a sequence of ones and zeroes. Using different methods of translating (_encoding_) information to binary, we can represent all kinds of data. For instance, the number 6 can be represented as 110 (1 x 4 + 1 x 2 + 0 x 1) but we can also encode text or images. When you read about things like _utf-8_ encoding or _jpeg_ and _gif_, these refer to methods of encoding and storing complex data as ones and zeroes."

    "When you save a file, the data in the file is converted to bits and stored on your computer's _hard disk_. This is memory that is _persistent_, meaning it stays preserved when you shut down your computer. This is very convenient for long term storage of data, but reading from and writing to (the input/output or _I/O_) the hard disk is quite slow.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For faster manipulation of data in memory, your computer has Random Access Memory or _RAM_. RAM is not persistent but _volatile_, meaning that the contents are lost when you shut down your computer. When we talk about memory in programming, this is usually what we are referring to.  \n",
    "When you think of variables in programming, these are stored in RAM. Reading a file to use the data inside it for instance, stores those data in RAM. To preserve the computations we've executed we generally write our data structures to a file on the disk.  \n",
    "\n",
    "A third type of memory that computers use is the _CPU cache_. The CPU is the Central Processing Unit, also known as the _processor_ of your computer, the part that does all the actual work of adding up and subtracting ones and zeroes. To have extremely rapid access to the data it is working on, the CPU has a very small memory buffer directly on the chip.  \n",
    "This cache is so small that most of the time, the data we're working on don't even fit in the cache. When programming in Python, managing what is sent to the cache and what is copied back to RAM is handled for you so you usually don't have to worry about it."

    "### 1.2 Programming languages\n",
    "As mentioned above, when you are programming in Python, some things are handled for you behind the scenes. Actually, __a lot__ is handled for you behind the scenes, considering that all this code and data is really ones and zeroes, deep down.  \n",
    "You can think of the processor as a huge grid of tiny switches. To execute a computation, we set the switches to a certain position and run our data through them in binary form. The instructions to tell the processor what bits to switch, exactly, are written in a language called machine code.  \n",
    "Thinking about the low level machine code that controls the individual bits is way too complex and time-consuming for us to bother with, which is why as soon as computers were developed, people started working on programming languages that simplify telling the processor what to do.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a modern version of such a language. It has high level commands for doing things like addition and subtraction, but also for sorting and searching, things that would be hugely time-consuming to tell the processor to do in machine code. To translate these high level commands to low level machine code instructions, Python comes with an _interpreter_, the program that actually executes your code.  \n",
    "Not all languages are _interpreted_, some, like C and C++, are _compiled_. A compiled language is turned into machine code all in one go, often with checking for programming errors beforehand. This allows the _compiler_ program to optimize the code and while this takes time, the resulting code often runs very quickly.  \n",
    "Python (and R) is a little different in that your code is read and interpreted into machine code virtually line by line. The downside is that you get little to no error checking beforehand and somewhat slower speeds. The benefit is that you can have an interactive session like the one in this notebook, where you can play with code on the fly.\n",
    "\n",
    "As with translations in real life, it's not always straightforward to translate between high-level Python code and low-level machine code. Often, the methods Python offers represent an _abstraction_ of the actual operations executed behind the scenes. Sometimes, these abstractions don't work perfectly and it becomes necessary to look into what's happening behind the scenes. When this happens we say the abstraction is _leaky_.  \n",
    "One example would be that when you are working with large arrays of data that do not fit into the processor cache, a program can become very slow. You normally don't have to worry about transferring data between RAM and CPU cache in Python (it's automatic) but in this case cutting your arrays into more managably sized can help."
