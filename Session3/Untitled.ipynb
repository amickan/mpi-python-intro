    "To write a usable program, it's good practice to structure your code into _functions_ that execute certain tasks. Creating separate functions for each well-defined task makes it easy to change the order in which you are doing things, or remove one step without accidentally breaking the program.  \n",
    "### 3.0.0 Defining a function\n",
    "To define a function, simply write `def function_name(parameter_1, paremeter_2, parameter_n):` and start the next line with a tab (similar to a loop or conditional statement from last week). The concept of _parameters_ is new, but it's really quite simple: these are variables that you put into the function when you _call_ it so you can do something with them.  \n",
